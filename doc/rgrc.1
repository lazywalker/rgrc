.SH NAME

\fBrgrc\fR - Rusty Generic Colouriser

.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBrgrc\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fICOMMAND\fR [\fIargs\fR] ...

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBrgrc\fR runs any command and colourises its output according to a set of rules. Rules are imported from \fBgrc\fR and \fBgrcat\fR configuration files.

.SH OPTIONS

- \fB--help\fR  
  Show summary of options.

- \fB--aliases\fR  
  Output a list of shell commands to generate aliases for supported and installed binaries.

- \fB--all-aliases\fR  
  Output a list of shell commands with aliases for all supported binaries.

- \fB--except\fR=\fIalias\fR[,\fIalias\fR[,...]]  
  List of aliases to exclude from list of shell commands generated by \fB--aliases\fR or \fB--all-aliases\fR.

- \fB--color\fR=[on,off,auto]  
  Enable/disable color output (default auto).

.SH CONFIGURATION FILES

\fBrgrc\fR reads its configuration from all of the following locations (same format as \fBrgrc.conf\fR), if available. All matching rules are read and used.

    ~/.rgrc
    ~/.config/rgrc/rgrc.conf
    /usr/local/etc/rgrc.conf
    /etc/rgrc.conf
    ~/.grc
    ~/.config/grc/grc.conf
    /usr/local/etc/grc.conf
    /etc/grc.conf

Any \fBgrcat\fR configuration (e.g. \fBconf.\fR_xyz_) are searched for in all of these locations. Only the first found file is read and used.

    ~/.config/rgrc
    ~/.local/share/rgrc
    /usr/local/share/rgrc
    /usr/share/rgrc
    ~/.config/grc
    ~/.local/share/grc
    /usr/local/share/grc
    /usr/share/grc

To extend the existing configuration for a command that is already configured, simply add a new rule in \fB~/.rgrc\fR and have a unique \fBconf.\fR_command_. To replace existing rules for a known command, create \fB~/.config/rgrc/conf.\fR_command_ and it will be used instead of the one from \fB/usr/share/grc\fR.
